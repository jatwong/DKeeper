# DKeeper Project

Upgrading a previous note keeping project to use Dfinity's Internet Computer with Angela Yu from the Web Development Bootcamp.

We bring this note keeping project to the ICP blockchain to manage our notes.

Design by Angela. I am responsible for the backend process and some minor UX updates.
